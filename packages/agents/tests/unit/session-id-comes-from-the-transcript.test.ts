/**
 * The session id is IN the transcript, not in its filename.
 *
 * `@theokit/sdk@5.x` changed where a transcript is written:
 *
 *   4.52.1  `${safeSessionId(sessionId)}.jsonl`   — the filename IS the id
 *   5.0.1   `${sessionUuidFor(sessionId)}.jsonl`  — SHA-256 over a namespace, one-way
 *
 * `listSessions` derived the id by stripping `.jsonl` from the name, so on 5.x every caller got a
 * UUID where it expected the id it had passed in. That is one defect with many faces: listing,
 * protection, GC and deletion all key on that id, so all of them broke together
 * (usetheokit/theokit#654).
 *
 * The SDK exports no reverse mapping and `sessionUuidFor` is in no `.d.ts`, so re-deriving the name
 * is not available and reimplementing the hash would be a second implementation of an SDK internal
 * — the failure `subagents-loader`'s docblock says this layer exists to prevent.
 *
 * The record itself carries `sessionId`, on both majors, written by the SDK. Reading the id from
 * the content is authoritative rather than inferred, and it is the same answer under either naming
 * scheme — which is what lets one package support both.

    // "reporting the on-disk name is worse than the id and far better than dropping the session out
    // of the listing". The second half is right and still holds: the entry is still listed. The
    // first half is not. On 5.x the name is a one-way hash, so the fallback was not a worse id, it
    // was an identifier belonging to no session — and protection was keyed on it, which made a
    // DECLARED-protected session collectable.

    // Listing an entry and naming it are separate properties. The entry survives; the name does not
    // get invented.
