/**
 * theokit#668 — "I could not read this transcript" and "this transcript belongs to nobody" are
 * opposite claims, and the listing collapsed them into one by falling back to the filename stem.
 *
 * Under `@theokit/sdk` 5.x that stem is `sessionUuidFor(id)`, a one-way hash, so the fallback did
 * not return a degraded id — it returned an identifier belonging to no session. Protection was then
 * looked up BY that id, so a session someone declared protected lost its protection.
 *
 * The fix runs the mapping in the direction that HAS a function. `transcriptPath(root, cwd, id)` is
 * total on both majors; the inverse is not. So protection is keyed by TRANSCRIPT PATH, computed
 * forward from the ids that protect, and whether the file can be read stops mattering to it.
 *
 * Every assertion here holds on both supported majors. The end-to-end protection case is marked
 * where it can only FAIL on 5.x, rather than being written as if it proved the same thing on 4.x.
