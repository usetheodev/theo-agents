/**
 * A release the root record does not name is a release the gate will fail — days later, on
 * somebody else's pull request.
 *
 * Measured on 2026-09-04 (usetheokit/theokit#656): the `Version Packages` commit 9c518579a bumped
 * `create-theokit` to 2.0.0-next.1 and did not touch the root CHANGELOG, because `[Unreleased]`
 * had been drained by the PREVIOUS cut. `record-root-changelog.mjs` returned early — correctly by
 * its own contract — and `check-changelog-current.mjs` then failed for three hours until an
 * unrelated PR (#655) was the next CI run.
 *
 * The two scripts disagreed: one treats an empty `[Unreleased]` as nothing to do, the other treats
 * an unnamed release as a defect. The heading is what settles it — the gate matches on the HEADING
 * naming the version, never on the body.
 *
 * This does NOT weaken the sibling rule that the recorder must not invent an entry
 * (`root-changelog-is-recorded-by-the-release.test.ts`). A heading is a fact about what was cut and
 * when. Change prose is a claim about what changed, and stays the human's to write.
